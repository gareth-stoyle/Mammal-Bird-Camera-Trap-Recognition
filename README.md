# Recognizing European mammals and birds in camera trap images using convolutional neural networks

This repository provides models, metric evaluations and the test data set presented in the paper "Recognizing European mammals and birds in camera trap images using convolutional neural networks".

The repository is structured as follows:

- `models` contains a download script for the best models from our paper and a code snippet to perform predictions with these models
- `evaluation` contains additional tables and plots from our model evaluation
- `data` contains details about our training data sets as well as a download script for our Marburg Open Forest (MOF) test data set.
