#  European Mammal and Bird Recognition in Camera Trap Images

This repository provides models, metric evaluations and the test data sets presented in the papers "Recognizing European mammals and birds in camera trap images using convolutional neural networks" (Schneider et al., 2023) and "Recognition of European mammals and birds in camera trap images using deep neural networks" (Schneider et al., 2024).

The repository is structured as follows:

- `models` contains download script for the best models from our 2023 and 2024 papers and a code snippet to perform predictions with these models.
- `evaluation` contains high-resolution images of the confusion matrices from our papers.
- `data` contains details about our training data sets as well as a download script for our Marburg Open Forest (MOF) and Białowieża National Park (BNP) test data sets.
